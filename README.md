# Travelling Salesman Problem - Ant Colony Optimization algorithm

The aim of this project is to create a Python program that, when executed, solves a particular case of the TSP (using the ACO algorithm) and, at the same time, generates an animation that shows how the algorithm works.

The program will use:
1. Pyhton's NumPy library to perform certain vectorized operations.
2. Pyhton's Matplotlib library to generate the images.
3. ImageMagick to assemble the images into an animation.
